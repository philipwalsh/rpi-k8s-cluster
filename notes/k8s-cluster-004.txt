from https://kuber.host/docs/kubectl_tricks

i dont like vi, as the default editor, so change it

in ~/.bashrc put this line in
export KUBE_EDITOR="nano" # for nano


this didnt work, yet, supposedely i can try adding it to ./xshrc also

or you can call the editor like this
KUBE_EDITOR="nano" kubectl edit deployment nginx-deploy-1
