rpi initial setup
grab lite version of raspbian from raspberrypi.org
burn/install to sd cards
plug sd cards into kali (or other linux distro) and modify a few files
	/media/kali/rootfs/etc/hostname --change hostname
	/media/kali/rootfs/etc/hosts    -- do same name replacement

* had issues with first build, file system was currupt, kept loading as read only, i was not too far into the rocess
  so i reloaded from scratch.  used the rpi image burner and reloaded.

after rebuild of worker2 os, i recieve this error
SHA256:805M/fvc7AHFvwLUehKy3G6WjqHmvLkXS/uYAQxjKQg.
